The code is in asteroids.py. Code to try out pygame is in tests. 

At this point, the "asteroids" are just squares that disappear when shot. 
Neither the gun nor the asteroids change location. 
The gun can rotate and shoot bullets in the correct direction. 

Keyboard: a to rotate counter-clockwise, s to rotate clockwise, p to pause, x to quit, space to shoot.

Next steps:
- move gun
- move asteroids
- break asteroids in pieces when shot
- asteroids as randomly irregular polygons instead of squares
- keep score
- sounds
