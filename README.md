The code is in asteroids.py. Code to try out pygame is in tests. 

At this point, the "asteroids" are just squares that disappear when shot. 
They move across the screen, wrapping around when they hit a border.
The gun doesn't change location. 
It can rotate and shoot bullets in the correct direction. 

Keyboard: a to rotate counter-clockwise, s to rotate clockwise, p to pause, x to quit, space to shoot.

Next steps:
- move gun
- collision with asteroid kills gun and stops game
- break asteroids in pieces when shot
- asteroids as randomly irregular polygons instead of squares
- add enemy spaceship
- keep score
- sounds
