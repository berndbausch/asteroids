The code is in asteroids.py. Code to try out pygame is in tests. 

At this point, the "asteroids" are just squares that disappear when shot. 
They rotate, move across the screen, wrapping around when they hit a border.
The gun doesn't change location. 
It is controlled by the keyboard to rotate and shoot bullets in the correct direction. 
When hit by an asteroid, the gun explodes and pieces of debris float away.

Keyboard: a to rotate counter-clockwise, s to rotate clockwise, p to pause, x to quit, space to shoot.

Next steps:
- move gun
- break asteroids in pieces when shot
- asteroids as randomly irregular polygons instead of squares
- add enemy spaceship
- keep score
- sounds
